# Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the list sorted in ascending order.
# Example:
# Input: [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# To get an array input from the user in Python, you can use the following code:

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
# This will take a space-separated input of integers and convert it into a list of integers.
print(arr)
