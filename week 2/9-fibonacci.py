# Write a function that prints the first n Fibonacci numbers.
# Where n is the user input.
# Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
# Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
# So if the user inputs 10, the output should be:
# The sum of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
